# GMod Discord RPC (GDiscord)

## For Clients
Download the latest version of the GDiscord module from the [releases page](https://github.com/Lythium4848/gmod-discord-rpc/releases). 
The module you need depends on what OS and version you're running (eg. Windows on 32-bit should download **gmcl_gdiscord_win32.dll**). If you're running the 64-bit beta, make sure you download the 64.dll!

Copy this into **lua/bin/**. That's all!

With this module installed, your Discord status should automatically update when playing on supported servers.
